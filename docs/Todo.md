# üéØ Project Vision
Goal: Build a best-in-class, autonomous agent that provides a significant speed advantage in a competitive real estate market. The agent will demonstrate robust scraping techniques, intelligent filtering, and reliable, real-time communication, all orchestrated within the modular Agno framework.

Key Success Factors:

‚úÖ Speed & Reliability: The agent must scan sources frequently (‚â§ 5 mins) and deliver notifications within seconds of a match. Uptime and resilience are paramount.
‚úÖ Accuracy: The filtering logic must be precise to avoid false positives, and the duplicate prevention mechanism must be virtually foolproof.
‚úÖ Security & Discretion: User credentials and data must be handled with utmost security. Scraping activities must be designed to be as discreet as possible to minimize the risk of being blocked.
‚úÖ Modularity & Scalability: The architecture must allow for the easy addition of new scanning sources (e.g., Komo) and new features (e.g., advanced analytics) in the future.

1. Architectural Design & Agent Skill Definition

The "RealtyScanner" will be a single Agno agent that utilizes a suite of specialized, independent Tools (Skills).

Agent (RealtyScanner): The central orchestrator. Its main loop runs every 5 minutes.

Fetches the user's active search profiles from the database.

For each profile, it triggers the Yad2ScannerTool and FacebookScannerTool in parallel.

It passes the results from the scanners to the ContentAnalysisTool.

If the analysis tool returns a "match," it triggers the NotificationDispatcherTool.

It uses the LoggingTool (or integrated logging) to record all actions.

Tool 1: Yad2ScannerTool

Responsibility: Scrape new listings from Yad2 based on a search profile.

Input: A search profile object (containing location, price, rooms, etc.).

Logic:

Constructs the specific Yad2 search URL from the profile criteria.

Uses Playwright or a simple HTTP library (requests + BeautifulSoup) to fetch the search results page.

Parses the HTML to extract key data for each listing (ID, link, price, rooms, location snippet, image URL).

For each extracted listing, it checks against the ScannedListings database to see if it's new.

Output: A list of new, raw listing data objects.

Tool 2: FacebookScannerTool

Responsibility: Scrape new posts from specified Facebook groups. (Highest Risk Tool)

Input: A search profile object (containing a list of Facebook Group URLs) and user authentication context.

Logic:

Uses Playwright to manage a persistent browser context with the user's logged-in session (via cookies).

Iterates through the list of group URLs.

For each group, it scrolls down the page, checking post timestamps or IDs against the last known scanned post ID for that group (state managed in the DB).

Parses the raw text, images, and any linked Marketplace data from new posts.

Output: A list of new, raw post data objects.

Tool 3: ContentAnalysisTool

Responsibility: Analyze raw data and determine if it's a match.

Input: A raw listing/post object and the corresponding search profile.

Logic:

Normalization: Cleans the input text (removes emojis, standardizes currency symbols).

Keyword Matching: Checks post text against location keywords (neighborhood, streets).

Numeric Filtering: Extracts and compares price and room count against the profile's min/max values.

Duplicate Hashing: Creates a unique hash of the core listing content (e.g., price + rooms + first 50 chars of description) to double-check for duplicates across different groups.

Decision: Returns a "match" object if all criteria are met, otherwise returns null.

Output: A formatted "matched listing" object or null.

Tool 4: NotificationDispatcherTool

Responsibility: Format and send notifications.

Input: A "matched listing" object and user's notification preferences.

Logic:

Formats a concise, clear message including source, details, a direct link, and an image URL.

Connects to the relevant API based on user preferences:

Twilio API for WhatsApp.

Telegram Bot API for Telegram.

SendGrid/Mailgun API for Email.

Sends the message.

Logs the sent notification to the SentNotifications database.

Output: Success or Failure status.

4. Required External API Integrations

Scraping (Implicit): Facebook & Yad2 websites. Not a formal API, but the primary integration.

WhatsApp: Twilio API for WhatsApp. Requires setting up a Twilio account and an approved message template.

Telegram: Telegram Bot API. Requires creating a bot via BotFather and getting an API token. This is often the easiest and cheapest to start with.

Email: SendGrid or Mailgun API. Requires account setup and domain verification for reliable delivery.

5. Primary Technical Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

Challenge 1: Facebook Scraping & Account Blocking (The #1 Risk)

Problem: Facebook actively tries to prevent automated scraping. Using a user's credentials directly is risky and can lead to temporary or permanent account locks, CAPTCHAs, and login challenges.

Mitigation Strategy (Multi-layered):

Authentication: Use Playwright to load an existing, authenticated browser profile/cookie state. Avoid direct username/password logins in every run. The user must perform the initial login manually in the Playwright-controlled browser, and the agent will reuse that session.

Human-like Behavior: Implement realistic, randomized delays between actions. Mimic scrolling behavior instead of instantly jumping to content. Use a legitimate User-Agent string.

Resilient Selectors: Use CSS selectors that are less likely to change (e.g., based on data-testid attributes if available) rather than relying on brittle, auto-generated selectors.

Error Handling: If a login challenge or CAPTCHA is detected, the agent must not try to solve it. It should immediately stop, log the error, and send a high-priority alert to the user on a pre-configured channel (e.g., "RealtyScanner requires you to re-login to Facebook to continue scanning").

Proxies (Advanced): For higher reliability, route scraping traffic through a residential proxy service to avoid IP-based blocking.

Challenge 2: Scraper Brittleness (Yad2 & Facebook)

Problem: Websites change their layout and HTML structure, which breaks scrapers.

Mitigation Strategy:

Modular Scrapers: Keep the parsing logic for each source in its own isolated file. If Yad2 changes, you only need to fix yad2_scraper.py, not the whole system.

Robust Error Logging: If a required HTML element is not found, log a detailed error message (e.g., "Failed to find price element on Yad2 listing URL: ...").

Monitoring & Alerting: Create a monitoring job that checks if scrapers are consistently failing for a specific source and alerts the administrator/user.

Challenge 3: Secure Credential & Secret Management

Problem: Storing user credentials, API keys (Twilio, Telegram), and session cookies insecurely is a major vulnerability.

Mitigation Strategy:

NEVER Hardcode Secrets: Use environment variables for all API keys.

Secure Storage for User Data: For session cookies, encrypt the file on disk using a key stored in a secure vault or environment variable.

Secrets Management Service (Production-grade): For a more robust solution, use a service like AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault to manage all credentials. The Agno agent would fetch them at runtime.

6. User-Facing Management Dashboard (Description)

A simple, clean web interface (e.g., built with Streamlit, Flask, or React) would be the ideal control panel.

MVP Dashboard Components:

Login: Secure login for the user to access their dashboard.

Search Profiles Manager:

A list of their current search profiles.

Each item shows: Profile Name, Status (Active/Paused), and key criteria (e.g., "Tel Aviv, 5-7k, 2-3 rooms").

Buttons to Edit, Pause/Resume, and Delete a profile.

A button to "Add New Profile" which opens a form with all the required fields (location, price, FB groups, etc.).

Live Notification Log:

A reverse-chronological feed of the last 50 notifications sent by the agent.

Each entry contains the formatted message and a timestamp. This allows the user to see what the agent is finding for them.

Settings / Status:

A section to update notification channel details (e.g., change Telegram Chat ID).

A status indicator for each scanning source (e.g., "Yad2: OK ‚úÖ", "Facebook: Requires Re-Authentication ‚ö†Ô∏è").

A button to securely trigger the re-authentication process for Facebook.

This plan provides a solid, actionable foundation for building the RealtyScanner agent. The immediate next step is to begin Phase 1: Foundation & Yad2 Scraping to gain quick wins and validate the core notification pipeline before tackling the complexities of Facebook integration.
